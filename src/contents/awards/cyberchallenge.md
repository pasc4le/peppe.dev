I had the opportunity to take part in the fifth edition of one of biggest cybersecurity competitions
in Italy. After several entry tests, I got to follow a 72h course taught by professors from the
Federico II University of Naples and the Parthenope University. At the end of which, a selected
group of 6 students got to compete with teams from other universities in Italy.
