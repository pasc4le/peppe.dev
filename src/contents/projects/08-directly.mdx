This project was intended as a way to use social media without its addictive nature. It basically consists of a proxy that serves content from the desired social media platform given its link, and a frontend that can display that content without any other features. It's essentially a glorified video player.

You can check out the backend on GitHub. For the frontend I “used” Flutter (or at least tried to), but I don’t like how it turned out. It was more of a fun side project for my free time, but because maintaining such a proxy is very time-consuming, I decided to discontinue it. If you're interested in the topic, I'd take a look at [farside](https://farside.link/).
