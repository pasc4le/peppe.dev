This project was developed for a high school PCTO activity focused on raising awareness about architectural barriers.
The idea was to create a platform where users could report the locations of these barriers, in order to then
communicate with official authorities to find a solution, if possible.

Currently there is no deployment of this website because I needed the project space on supabase for something else.
