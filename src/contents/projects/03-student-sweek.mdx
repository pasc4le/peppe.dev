This project started in high school, where the students committee had to find a solution about how to manage the
"students' week", a week in school where students can teach courses about what they like. Managing this may seem
like an easy task, but having to do it for 1k+ people at the same time could be challenging.

This platform solves this problem. It has been used by multiple schools in the last 5 years, but it's currently
discontinued due to a lack of a maintainer. If you'd like to pick up the project, shoot me an email at
[giuseppe.pascale@ieee.org](mailto:giuseppe.pascale@ieee.org).
