import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components";

It's exactly what you're looking at right now! This is my personal website, and because I'm all for open source, you can find the source code for free on GitHub, or by clicking the button below.

The stack used: Astro, Turso DB for caching the GitHub releases, and Svelte for reactive components on the frontend.

<Button type="primary" href="https://github.com/pasc4le/peppe.dev">
  Github
  <Icon name="mdi:github" is:inline={true} class="text-current h-6 w-6" />
</Button>
