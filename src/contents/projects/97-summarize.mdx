This is a CLI to summurize videos into markdown files. It uses whisper.cpp in order
to transcirbe the videos locally and then Gemini to generate the markdown from
the transcription. It can additionally generates subtitles for your videos, from
the whisper output.

This was my first attempt at using AI for coding, I've made this project with
[opencode](https://opencode.ai/) using Github Copilot with Claude Sonnet 4.1.
I still have mixed feelings about it, but it seems a good tool for generating
small personal projects.
