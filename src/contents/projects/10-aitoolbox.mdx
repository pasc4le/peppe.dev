This is a side-project that I've started because I had the frequent need of generating specific
things with LLMs: flash cards, bullet lists, markdown files, notion notes. So I wanted to create a
website where people could share their configuration models and parsing, easy and accesible.

But due to the introduction of MCP servers support on basically all the mainstream LLMs, I
find this project not really needed. You can still checkout a POC with the button below.
