import Button from "@/components/general/Button.astro";
import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components";

This is a personal project that I've started in high school in order to play
hide and seek across big areas. The idea was to make the game dynamic, by
introducing the possibility to collect gold and points, having different
effects that could be activated on the players, shrinking the hiding area
to different zone stages and more.

It only partially came into completion, it was used several times to play,
occasionally it gets revived but now the supabase project attached to it is
paused. You can still check the source code and maybe try to hook it up
with your supabase project with the button below.

<Button type="primary" href="https://github.com/pasc4le/nascondino">
  Github
  <Icon name="mdi:github" is:inline={true} class="h-6 w-6" />
</Button>
