This is a project commissioned from an hotel/wedding place in southern Italy. It's a platform
used to manage messages coming from different socials all in one dashboard. This speeds up
chat support, customer experience and can be attached to other services (e.g. CRMs, Hotel Management Systems, etc.)
in order to have a complete overview of the interactions with the customer. Unfortunately, due to
copyright I cannot show a demo of it, but I can explain how it was made.

Each social media message provider interacts with the platform through a service called "agent". This agent
is usually a web server that gets called via WebHooks from the social media provider (e.g. for Meta, WhatsApp, etc).

Then, these agents communicate over a Redis pub/sub channel to a master agent. This agent serves different purposes:
receiving all the messages and updates from the satellite agents, check the health and existence of satellite agents,
handling the RESTful API and serving the frontend.

The platform is supposed to handle multiple tenants, each with their own collection of social media providers for
messages. The modularity of this project makes it very easily upgradable. Because agents are completely independent
from the main server, they can be written in any language, but an SDK to write them following the communication protocol
was provided in TypeScript.

It was a fun ride, I've learnt a lot and it was fun working in a team.
