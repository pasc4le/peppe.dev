import Button from "@/components/general/Button.astro";

This is a small project, a simple html file, that renders an exam defined as JSON following a specific
schema (that you can find in `/schema.json`). It's more of an excuse to try [alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) if I have to be
completely honest.

<Button type="primary" href="https://github.com/pasc4le/exam-renderer">

  <Icon name="mdi:github" />
